## 🤖 Project Overview

The aim of this project is to simulate and create a pixhawk based delivery drone which can carry a parcel from one location to another, first manually using remote control, and then autonomously. A rigorous simulation on a model similar to the actual drone will be carried on Gazebo using the PX4 firmware, to test the drone's efficiency in every possible scenario and ensure that the drone, as well as the parcel, remain safe in most of the cases.

### 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Assemble and control the drone without GPS and telemetery
- ✅ Simulate the default iris quadcoptor on Gazebo
- ✅ Import a custom drone model in the PX4 environment
- 🟡 Simulate the custom drone on gazebo
- 🟡 Test the gripper in the simulation
- 🟡 Modify basic parameters like thrust, mass, gravity etc. to account for all eventualities
- 🟡 Add the gripper to the pixhawk quadcopter and fly the quadcopter with a payload (parcel)
- 🟡 Automate the entire process

## ⏱️ Project Timeline
Main idea is to build a very very basic version first, probably within 2 weeks and then work on modifying it, (believer me doing otherwise is stupidity...)

### Week 1: Introduction
- Review the competition rulebook
-  Be familiar with github
-  Brainstorm ideas and design concepts based in the video,
-  Prepare Bill of Materials
-  Draft electronic system diagram
-  !TODO()


### Week 2: Hardware Assembly
-  Assemble mechanical components
- !TODO()

### Week 3: Debugging
-  Hardware and software troubleshooting
-  !TODO()

### Week 4: Algorithm Refinement
-  Enhance hardware robustness
-  !TODO()

### Weeks 5-7: Progressive Enhancements
- 🔄 Implement iterative improvements (tbd)
- !TODO()
